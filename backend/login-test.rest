5. Test login endpoint with user IDs and passwords
6. Verify JWT tokens are returned correctly

2: Frontend Integration Testing
1. Start frontend Vite dev server
2. Test login with each user (Ashley, Lachlan, Alex)
3. Verify dashboard loads with appropriate data
4. Test navigation between pages
5. Test incident creation
6. Test role-based features
